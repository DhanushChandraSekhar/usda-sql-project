# USDA SQL Data Analysis Project

## 🗂 Description
This project uses real-world datasets from the USDA to analyze U.S. commodity production (cheese, milk, honey, yogurt, etc.) using SQL. It answers 10 business-focused questions with SQL queries.

## 📁 Files
- `usda_project.sql`: SQL script with all queries
- Optional: `/data/` folder containing CSVs (not included here)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- SQLite
- DBeaver

## ✅ SQL Techniques Used
- `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `IN`, `NOT IN`
- `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Subqueries, filtering, data validation

## 📊 Example Questions Answered
- Which states produced both honey and milk in 2022?
- Average coffee production where honey exceeded 1M
- States missing April 2023 data
- Yogurt production in states that also made cheese in 2023

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Create the database (SQLite)
2. Import the schema
3. Run queries in `usda_project.sql`
